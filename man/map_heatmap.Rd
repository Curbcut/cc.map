\title{Add a heatmap layer to a map}
\usage{
map_heatmap(
  session,
  map_ID,
  tileset,
  radius = list("interpolate", list("linear"), list("zoom"), 0, 1, 10, 8, 12, 10, 15, 30),
  filter = list("all"),
  pickable = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{session}{<\code{shiny::session}> The Shiny session object.}

\item{map_ID}{<\code{character}> A unique identifier for the map input.}

\item{tileset}{<\code{character}> The tileset to be used for the heatmap.}

\item{radius}{<\code{list}> The definition of radius based on the zoom level,
it is a nested list including 'interpolate', 'linear', zoom levels and
corresponding radius values. It defaults to a list that specifies the
radius at different zoom levels. It is a list defining the radius of influence
of data points in pixels. It is structured as an interpolation expression
following Mapbox's style specification, and it allows the radius to change
according to the zoom level of the map. The default values are set such
that the radius is 1 at zoom level 0, 8 at zoom level 10, and 30 at zoom
level 15. You can adjust these values according to your needs.}

\item{filter}{<\code{list}> A list specifying the filter for heatmap data,
defaults to 'all' which includes all data. It  is a list specifying which data
to include in the heatmap. By default, it's set to "all", which means all
data in the tileset will be included. It can be customized to include specific
subsets of the data. For the \code{crash} data in Montreal, tileset have a \code{ped}
and \code{cyc} column including a boolean. To only filter pedestrian, this would
be the correct argument: \code{list("==", list("get", "ped"), TRUE)}}

\item{pickable}{\if{html}{\out{<logical>}} Should there be hovered effect, indicating the
layer can be pickable? Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
No return value. The function sends an update message to the Shiny
server to update the map.
}
\description{
This function adds a heatmap layer to a map. It generates a configuration
list that includes the tileset, radius, filter, and pickable options for
the heatmap, and sends this configuration to the server to update the map.
