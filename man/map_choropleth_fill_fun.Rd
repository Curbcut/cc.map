\title{Create a JSON object for fill-color in Mapbox choropleth}
\usage{
map_choropleth_fill_fun(df, get_col = names(df)[1], fallback = "transparent")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{<\code{data.frame}> Data frame of two columns. The first is the value that
match the tile (e.g. field \code{ID_colour}, which every normal choropleth tile should have),
and the second column is hexes (the fill colour).}

\item{get_col}{<\code{character}> Name of the feature value to match the fill color
to the tileset. Defaults to the name of the first column of \code{df}, which more
often than not, should be \code{ID_colour} (value shared by all the normal choropleth
tileset, included at import.).}

\item{fallback}{<\code{character}> Fallback color if no match is found (default is
"transparent")}
}
\value{
A JSON object representing the fill-color mapping
}
\description{
This function takes a data frame and generates a JSON object that represents
the fill-color mapping paint property for a Mapbox choropleth map. It matches
the values from the specified column with their corresponding colors and includes
a fallback color. This function will use the match decision syntax, as is
documented here: https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/expressions/#match
}
